This script gathers relevant information from 7 text files and ultimately distills it into two seperate tables:

1. Tidy Data Set - The set of 10299 observations of test and training data for 30 subjects performing 6 Activities. Each observation contains 79 specific measurements realated to mean and standard deviation
2. Activity averages by Subject - A
